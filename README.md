# Frontend React Application for Ollama models

🧠 Ollama Frontend Interface
A modern, interactive React app that connects with Ollama models, providing an enhanced user experience with file upload capabilities.
Easily send files to models for more dynamic and rich interactions!

✨ Features
🔥 Connect to any Ollama model (local or remote)
📂 Upload files (PDF, TXT, CSV, etc.) to use as model context
🧩 Dynamic input options: text, prompts, and file attachments
🎨 Beautiful UI built with TailwindCSS (or your framework)
⚡ Fast and responsive frontend performance
📡 API integration with Ollama's local server
🛠️ Easy to configure and extend

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Node.js (>=18.x)
Yarn or npm
Running Ollama server (local or cloud)

🖇️ File Upload Details
Files uploaded are sent along with your prompt to the Ollama model.
Supported file types: PDF, TXT, CSV (easy to extend to others).
Files are either:
Preprocessed client-side (e.g., extract text)
Or sent directly to the backend if server-side processing is needed.
You can customize how files are parsed or embedded based on your model's requirements.
